“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software,” borrowing the French or Spanish word for “free” as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.

We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them. With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them. When users don't control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of unjust power.

The four essential freedoms

A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:

The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

(see diagram)
Free software is a matter of freedom, not price. But proprietary software companies typically use the term “free software” to refer to price. Sometimes they mean that you can obtain a binary copy at no charge; sometimes they mean that a copy is bundled with a computer that you are buying, and the price includes both. Either way, it has nothing to do with what we mean by free software in the GNU project.

Many languages have two separate words for “free” as in freedom and “free” as in zero price. For example, French has “libre” and “gratuit”. Not so English; there is a word “gratis” that refers unambiguously to price, but no common adjective that refers unambiguously to freedom.

  Free software uses GNU General Public License (GNU GPL)

>  'Not all of the users and developers of free software agreed with the goals of the free software movement. In 1998, a part of the free software community splintered off and began campaigning in the name of “open source.” The term was originally proposed to avoid a possible misunderstanding of the term “free software,” but it soon became associated with philosophical views quite different from those of the free software movement.'

>  'The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the free software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users' freedom. By contrast, the philosophy of open source considers issues in terms of how to make software “better”—in a practical sense only. It says that nonfree software is an inferior solution to the practical problem at hand. Most discussion of “open source” pays no attention to right and wrong, only to popularity and success; here's a typical example.
>  For the free software movement, however, nonfree software is a social problem, and the solution is to stop using it and move to free software.'

Practical Differences between Free Software and Open Source
-----------------------------------------------------------

'All existing released free software source code would qualify as open source' but not vice versa. These exceptions are:

  1. software with restrictive licenses that 'does not allow making a modified version and using it privately', for example.

  2. 'products containing computers check signatures on their executable programs to block users from installing different executables; only one privileged company can make executables that can run in the device or can access its full capabilities. We call these devices “tyrants”, and the practice is called “tivoization” after the product (Tivo) where we first saw it. Even if the executable is made from free source code, the users cannot run modified versions of it, so the executable is nonfree.
  The criteria for open source do not recognize this issue; they are concerned solely with the licensing of the source code. Thus, these unmodifiable executables, when made from source code such as Linux that is open source and free, are open source but not free. Many Android products contain nonfree tivoized executables of Linux.'

“FLOSS”

The term “FLOSS,” meaning “Free/Libre and Open Source Software,” was coined as a way to be neutral between free software and open source. If neutrality is your goal, “FLOSS” is the best way to be neutral. But if you want to show you stand for freedom, don't use a neutral term.

“FOSS”

The term “FOSS,” meaning “Free and Open Source Software,” was coined as a way to be neutral between free software and open source, but it doesn't really do that. If neutrality is your goal, “FLOSS” is better. But if you want to show you stand for freedom, don't use a neutral term.

Instead of FOSS, we say, free software or free (libre) software.

commercial vs open source / free
================================

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Commercial
: "A program is commercial if it is developed as a business activity. A commercial program can be free or nonfree, depending on its manner of distribution. Likewise, a program developed by a school or an individual can be free or nonfree, depending on its manner of distribution. The two questions—what sort of entity developed the program and what freedom its users have—are independent."

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html
Commercial software

“Commercial” and “proprietary” are not the same! Commercial software is software developed by a business as part of its business. Most commercial software is proprietary, but there is commercial free software, and there is noncommercial nonfree software.

For example, GNU Ada is developed by a company. It is always distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, and every copy is free software; but its developers sell support contracts. When their salesmen speak to prospective customers, sometimes the customers say, “We would feel safer with a commercial compiler.” The salesmen reply, “GNU Ada is a commercial compiler; it happens to be free software.”

For the GNU Project, the priorities are in the other order: the important thing is that GNU Ada is free software; that it is commercial is just a detail. However, the additional development of GNU Ada that results from its being commercial is definitely beneficial.

Please help spread the awareness that free commercial software is possible. You can do this by making an effort not to say “commercial” when you mean “proprietary.”


http://peerproduction.net/issues/issue-1/peer-reviewed-papers/why-free-software-is-not-the-antonym-of-commercial-software/
NOTE: free and open source software is not an antonym of commercial software (proprietary is)

In other words, for this developer all the software covered by the GPL should be considered as a specific form of commercial software, to the extent that developers are entitled by the license to distribute copies of the software asking for a payment. This definition (FLOSS as commercial software), states the developer, is also supported by concrete examples such as the GNU/Linux commercial distributions.

NOTE: so you can sell it but you have to provide the source code and the buyer (or licensee) can further distribute the product with the same license (and its restrictions). The next quote further emphasizes that free/open source is not against commercial use:

Open Design Alliance members have created the following free utilities, based on the OpenDWG Libraries, for your unrestricted, non-commercial use. Please note that inclusion of any utility in a commercial product does require commercial licensing [14]
This post clarifies to GRASS developers that it is not possible for them to use the OpenDWG Library together with GRASS, due to the clear commercial nature of GRASS granted by the terms of the GPL (for instance by the term 1 ). Indeed, the OpenDWG source code can be freely used, as it is clearly stated above, but only for non-commercial purposes. Therefore we have an opposition between FLOSS and non-commercial software and not between FLOSS and commercial software.


copyleft vs copyright
=====================

https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html
Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything written down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs. Therefore, if you want a program you have written to be in the public domain, you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it; otherwise, the program is copyrighted.

Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms ensure that all copies of all versions carry more or less the same distribution terms. This means, for instance, that copyleft licenses generally disallow others to add additional requirements to the software (though a limited set of safe added requirements can be allowed) and require making source code available. This shields the program, and its modified versions, from some of the common ways of making a program proprietary.

Lessons for creating good open source software[edit]
====================================================

@bazaar
Raymond points to 19 "lessons" learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:[3]
Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man-Month)
If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

open source - pros and cons
===========================

http://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf

page 33 - 3x
mostly pros but the whole document is about hidden costs of open source


http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/reasons-organizations-opt-not-use-open-source-software

CONS

  * Open Source Isn't Free:
    you need either in-house expertise to deploy open source, or to contract with an organization that can provide that expertise. Both approaches are going to cost money.

    COUNTERARGUMENT: don't give people food but teach them how to fish and hunt. The above downside of open source software is just as true to proprietary software but the costs are higher (product AND support fees), learned in-house expertise is usually barely transferable to other software or fields because of highly specialized or distorted terminology and non-standard and/or obfuscated/obscured architectural design choices. e.g., salesforce administrators would be confused with another CRM where standard terms are used, or windows admins moving to open source operating systems where updates and installations are handled in a different way (but almost uniform among themselves)

    Another solution is education and the organization that embraces the notion that coding (or hacking) is going to be a common required skill, will therefore planning to stabilize its future in the long run.

  * compliance requirements
    That said, the fact that open source software in its raw form usually comes with no warranty or other official guarantee can make it more difficult to use in a business environment where compliance is a must. Plus, things can get complicated when your software stack includes dozens or hundreds of different pieces of open source code, all licensed in varying ways.

    The easy solution is to purchase open source software from a company that guarantees the whole product, like Red Hat or Suse. But that might undercut the attractiveness of open source in the first place for some organizations, especially ones that want it free. So there is always going to be a tradeoff in this respect.

    COUNTERARGUMENT:

    * Yes, are multiple free software and open source licenses and developers have to make sure that every component is compliant with the projects aim (and therefore, with its license). With open source developers cannot stick their head in the sand and have to be aware the implications of their contribution. Just as you cannot develop a software for a specific purpose without getting intimate with domain that product is for. It is just like basic maintenance of your car: unless you have a driver, you have to know the very basics of the car maintenance (what type of fuel to use (gas or diesel, octane etc), replace a tire).

   On the other hand, the end users have more freedom than using a proprietary software because

      1. no one reads the small print that has been the base of many legal battle

      2. the legal burden of understanding all the restrictions that the software may not be used and enforce these requiremeents on the staff.

        With FLOSS, the users are free, they can even alter the end product and suggest those changes back to the development team, who already worked out the details how the components can be compliant.

      3. Owners of proprietary products prefer to use terms that have no legal bindings (intellectual property, rights (see stallman)) to scare into compliance.

    * Confusion about the multiple meanings of the word 'free'. Free software does not mean that it is gratis. (e.g., rhel and sles are both commercial products but there source code is freely available)


  * defunct projects

    When you purchase commercial software, it usually comes with a guarantee of official support from the developers for a fixed period of time. Open source software that you acquire for free often does not.

    This is not universally true, of course. For example, Canonical guarantees support for LTS releases of Ubuntu for extended periods of time even though Ubuntu is free. Plus, it's not a completely sure thing that any support guarantees you get from commercial software will be honored. A company could always go out of business, just as an open source project could go defunct.

    Still, fewer open source products come with support or other longevity guarantees, and it is easier for a user to imagine a volunteer open source project going belly-up than a commercial software company. This, too, is a downside for people considering open source.

    COUNTERARGUMENT: The core principle of the open source model is that you are responsible to your project and it should be handed off to a successor. Companies using FLOSS tools are also contributing back to communities and oftentimes take over maintenance of open source projects that became orphan for multiple reasons: to support the community by giving back and the more practical reason because they rely on that product.

    This part also boils down to education and fostering the local or "close" (ie online) technical community and aspirations.


  * security

    Security is a touchy issue for open source fans. On the one hand, the Eric Raymond mantra (which he calls "Linus' Law," even though Raymond invented the term, not Linus Torvalds) that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" suggests that open code should be more secure because a lot of people can review it, which makes it easier to find security flaws.

    On the other hand, there is the argument that proprietary programs whose code is closed cannot be as easily inspected by malicious hackers who are looking for security holes to exploit. In other words, closed-source software has the advantage of security by obscurity.

    Deciding which development model, open or closed, is best for security is an argument that will never be won. There have been some embarrassing security fiascos for the open source community, like Heartbleed. But there have been plenty of similar ones for Windows, iOS and innumerable other closed-source platforms. (Blaster, anyone?)

    For people considering whether to use open source, however, the evidence here is not what matters. Instead, the simple fact that proprietary software companies can make certain arguments to claim their code is more secure can sway users away from open source, regardless of the actual reality.

    COUNTERARGUMENT: No single software is perfect. (not even hello world - it has side effects). A further addendum to Linus' Law is that it is easier to disclose vulnerabilities and they are easier to hide, prompting for immediate action (heartbleed). Whereas vulnerabilities exist to proprietary software as well that won't be disclosed to the public if it has been discovered internally (equifax) because of business interestests.

    Security through obscurity (i.e., closed source software) is not a silver bullet either and usually protects business interests only. Because these products are used by people and do not exist in vacuum. If there is interaction, it can be reverse-engineered. Once the vulnerability is disclosed a small team has to scramble to fix it. (NIST  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-123/final)

PROS

  * recruitment

    Open source developers are flexible and goal-oriented polyglots, well versed in multiple programmming paradigm to get the job done. The knowledge is also out it in the open to learn from.

  * faster and more diverse feedback

  * contributing to the community

    just as the project is using open source projects, whenever our development generates tools that can be used by the greater public, those can be shared as well. It is also free advertising and generates attention

licenses
========

basics
------
https://opensource.guide/legal/

> When you make a creative work (such as writing, graphics, or code), that work is under exclusive copyright by default. That is, the law assumes that as the author of your work, you have a say in what others can do with it. In general, that means nobody else can use, copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk of take-downs, shake-downs, or litigation.

> Open source is an unusual circumstance, however, because the author expects that others will use, modify, and share the work. But because the legal default is still exclusive copyright, you need a license that explicitly states these permissions.

> If you don’t apply an open source license, everybody who contributes to your project also becomes an exclusive copyright holder of their work. That means nobody can use, copy, distribute, or modify their contributions – and that “nobody” includes you.

> Finally, your project may have dependencies with license requirements that you weren’t aware of. Your project’s community, or your employer’s policies, may also require your project to use specific open source licenses. We’ll cover these situations below.

> If you want others to use, copy, modify, or contribute back to your project, you need to include an open source license. For example, someone cannot legally use any part of your GitHub project in their code, even if it’s public, unless you explicitly give them the right to do so.

A standardized license serves as a proxy for those without legal training to know precisely what they can and can’t do with the software.

MIT - allows anyone to do anything so long as they keep a copy of the license, including your copyright notice. You’ll be able to release the project under a different license if you ever need to.

Your project very likely has (or will have) dependencies. For example, if you’re open sourcing a Node.js project, you’ll probably use libraries from the Node Package Manager (npm). Each of those libraries you depend on will have its own open source license. If each of their licenses is “permissive” (gives the public permission to use, modify, and share, without any condition for downstream licensing), you can use any license you want. Common permissive licenses include MIT, Apache 2.0, ISC, and BSD.

On the other hand, if any of your dependencies’ licenses are “strong copyleft” (also gives public same permissions, subject to condition of using the same license downstream), then your project will have to use the same license. Common strong copyleft licenses include GPLv2, GPLv3, and AGPLv3.

You may also want to consider the communities you hope will use and contribute to your project:

Do you want your project to be used as a dependency by other projects? Probably best to use the most popular license in your relevant community. For example, MIT is the most popular license for npm libraries.
Do you want your project to appeal to large businesses? A large business will likely want an express patent license from all contributors. In this case, Apache 2.0 has you (and them) covered.
Do you want your project to appeal to contributors who do not want their contributions to be used in closed source software? GPLv3 or (if they also do not wish to contribute to closed source services) AGPLv3 will go over well.

https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/why-apache-defeated-the-gpl-license-developer-freedom-vs-user-freedom/2013/01/21
SUMMARY: more permissive licenses promote the growth of open source whereas GPL is so controversial that software with such license is best not considered

Adherents of GPL-style licensing continue to insist that all software should be free and the license must manacle any attempts to extend it with proprietary software. Unlike the Apache license, the GPL embeds the decision as to the code’s open source nature into the code itself: if you use the software, you must release any derivative works as open source. You have no choice. Apache is very different. Apache adherents believe that software can be free and is perhaps best when free. But, these same adherents are not prepared to force other developers to agree with them, and the license does not embed a final decision into the code itself. Downstream users of Apache-licensed software are given wide latitude as to how they use (and license) the software.
NOTE: this would serve us because we don't want the end product to be made nonfree by someone else but the building blocks are free

However, these early open source companies have not stood still. Taking their cue from the web companies, open source vendors such as Cloudera increasingly contribute heavily to a core open source project and then sell complementary proprietary software or services. This strategy allows them to contribute fully and without conflict to their chosen open source projects, even while making more money. Not surprisingly, since their primary aim is now developer adoption of these core open source projects, and not direct monetization of them, such companies generally turn to Apache-style licensing.

GPL or AGPLv3
------

e.g., CiviCRM


https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html

https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2012/05/using-gpl-licensed-components-in-proprietary-projects/

 The two most frequently found myths are:

 You cannot ask for license fees.
 The source code of the project must be published.
 If these claims were true, GPL-licensed software would indeed be unsuitable for proprietary projects. But they aren’t. So, let’s have a closer look and see what the situation is really like.

 The GPL does not contain any passage stating that license fees can not be asked for. The GPL faq list states explicitly that one can ask for license fees for software under the GPL (see, e.g., here).

 Neither does the GPL state that the source code has to be made public. It is the licensees and only the licensees who must be granted assess to the source code. And the licensor decides who his licensees are. The fact that a GPL-licensed component is publicly available, e.g., over the internet, does in no ways mean that a project building on this component must also be publicly available.


 “Ordinary” Client Projects
 An “ordinary” client project is a project where a software company develops an application for one particular client or a particular small set of clients, usually on demand of the client. Even in these projects, the use of GPL-licensed components can be feasible. Actually, the requirement to hand over the source code of the project to the client is not really a big restriction because contracts regularly contain clauses by which the source code is handed over anyway. Since the client pays for the development of the software he has the right to receive all artefacts of the development including the source.

 NOTE this clearly wasn't the case with slate...

 The issue that is more relevant here is that the client also receives the right to re-distribute the software including the option to ask for fees. So an important question here is whether or not the client may have an interest in re-distributing the software. Let’s consider two examples. Suppose your company developed an application which is not only useful for the client but also for many companies in the industrial sector of client. An example may be an application managing end customer data like addresses and payment management. Such a system is not particular specific to your client. He may thus have an interest in re-selling the application to his competitors. The GPL provides him the freedom to do so.

Suppose the application you create for your client is a software model of the core process of the client’s business model. The application models the key properties that sets the client ahead of his competitors. In the automotive industry, to give an example, this may be car configurator that directly interacts with order systems and production lines. The application is essential to the economic success of your client and constitutes one of his core values. In such a situation, the client has almost no reason at all to re-distribute the application. Thus, though the client is granted certain rights under the GPL, you can be quite sure the client has no interest in actually putting these rights to use. It is therefore a valid option to use GPL-licensed components in such projects.

NOTE: in our case re-distribution is a boon because we are a non profit and do not treat other agencies as competition. What about attribution? there you go:
