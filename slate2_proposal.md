I. Executive Summary
====================

II. Context
===========
Software to capture and to manage information regarding entities interacting with an organization are most commonly called CRMs. The use of the acronym as definition is appropriate here because its expansion depends on the context of the type of the organization using it.

1. Customer Relationship Management
-----------------------------------

Mostly used by commercial organizations to preserve "information about the interactions between a customer and a business" [@sh_crm] with a usually the one-dimensional goal to maximize profits [@wiki_crm].

2. Constituent (Relationship) Management
----------------------------------------

Non-profit organizations require a different approach to capture relationships. Even though they may have clients who receive services in some form, the word **customer** does not naturally apply to them. Its meaning is also too narrow to refer to entities (i.e., individual, agency etc.) connected to non-profits.

The umbrella term **constituent** better encompasses all the roles an entity can fulfill. A constituent is therefore someone who takes part in the life of the organization, sometimes taking on multiple roles during the same timeframe. Complexity is further exacerbated by the fact that each role has its own set of interactions and organizational requirements.

Examples for constituent roles are that of a client, a volunteer or a donor and these are reflected in the two most common approaches to digital constituent management by a non-profit:

* either use a collection of specialist CRMs, each of them developed for a specific purpose, such as

    + volunteer management systems (e.g., Volunteer Reporter, Samaritan)
    + donor management systems (e.g., Raiser's Edge, Talisma)
    + case and/or client management systems (e.g., Slate, ClientTrack)

* or a single CRM application that tries to satisfy all needs but usually to a certain extent (e.g., CiviCRM, Salesforce)

See [@techsoup;@idealware] for more examples but they are also relevant by pointing out pros and cons of each approach. Later sections of this proposal will further evaluate these solutions in the context of blindness organizations, focusing on accessibility and on the limiting factors such as the size of an agency.

III. Project rationale
======================

1. Problem statement
--------------------

2. Proposed solution
--------------------


For these very reasons, the roles are oftentimes managed together by each department, instead of departments dedicated to a specific role[^functional_departments].

[^functional_departments]: The reason behind this practice is manyfold but it is usually caused by tight budgets and as a corollary, employees having multiple responsibilites that blurs the line further. On the bright side, this simplifies management of most departments by decentralizing the sources of information on various constituent groups. Departments, that need the big picture, draw the short straw: data will need to be aggregated manually if automation is missing or difficult (if not impossible). An example for the latter is when the data managed by systems that do not directly communicate each other and/or their proprietary nature does not enable reliable workarounds.

specialist crm approach issues because of  functional_departments: everyone needs to use many different software (price, learning curve, differing levels of accessibility)
