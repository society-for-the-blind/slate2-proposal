Executive Summary
=================

Context
=======
Software to capture and to manage information regarding entities interacting with an organization are most commonly called CRMs. The use of the acronym as definition is appropriate here because its expansion depends on the context of the organization that uses it.

Customer Relationship Management
--------------------------------

Mostly used by commercial organizations to preserve "information about the interactions between a customer and a business" [@sh_crm] with a usually one-dimensional goal to maximize profits [@wiki_crm].
