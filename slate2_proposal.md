I. Executive Summary

II. Context
===========
Software to capture and to manage information regarding entities interacting with an organization are most commonly called CRMs. The use of the acronym as definition is appropriate here because its expansion depends on the context of the organization that uses it.

1. Customer Relationship Management
-----------------------------------

Mostly used by commercial organizations to preserve "information about the interactions between a customer and a business" [@sh_crm] with a usually one-dimensional goal to maximize profits [@wiki_crm].

2. Constituent (Relationship) Management
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Non-profit ofganizations require a different approach to capture relationships. Even though they may have clients who receive services in some form, the meaning of the word "customer" is too narrow to apply to all entities (i.e., individual, agency etc.) connected to them. The umbrella term "constituent" (applied broadly) better encompasses all the roles an entity can fulfill. A constituent is therefore someone who takes part in the life of the organization, such as donor, a client, a volunteer etc.

A constituent can have many roles and each of these roles interact with agency in different ways. For these reasons non-profits use

* either a collection of CRMs, each of them developed for a specific purpose, such as

    + volunteer management systems (e.g., Volunteer Reporter, Samaritan)
    + donor management systems (e.g., Raiser's Edge, Talisma)
    + case and/or client management systems (e.g., Slate, ClientTrack)

* or a single CRM application that tries to do all, such as CiviCRM or Salesforce
